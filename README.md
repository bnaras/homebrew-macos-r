# Modified MacOS R 

This is a very minor modification of
[sethrfore](https://github.com/sethrfore/homebrew-r-srf) for my own
use.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install bnaras/macos-r/rfix.rb`

Or `brew tap bnaras/macos-r` and then `brew install rfix`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bnaras/homebrew-macos-r/master/Formula/rfix.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
